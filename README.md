## What it does

The app allows the user to upload a picture of a number from 0-9 and it can determine what number is in the picture. 

## How we built it

The AI model was trained through Keras and Tensorflow and the data used was from the Mnist dataset. 

The frontend is built with Flask, and HTML/CSS

## Setup 

To run this program locally after copying the repository, a virtual environment must be set up. After setting up the virtual environment, the latest versions of Keras, Tensorflow and Flask should be installed. 

## How it looks 

Images can be found under the Digit_Recognition folder at Digit_Recognition/Homescreen.JPG, Digit_Recognition/Predict2.JPG, Digit_Recognition/Predict7.JPG

## Credits 

This project was inspired by my friends: Michael He (https://github.com/BATMOOSEMIKE), Kevin Fan and Wenfei. We worked on a similar project together called the Clothing Classifier in early March and I decided to recreate the machine learning model with a different dataset while using a similar front-end layout.
