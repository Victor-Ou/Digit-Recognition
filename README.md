## What it does

The app allows the user to upload a picture of a number from 0-9 and it can determine what number is in the picture. 

## How we built it

The AI model was trained through Keras and Tensorflow and the data used was from the Mnist dataset. 

The frontend is built with Flask, and HTML/CSS

## Setup guide

To run this web app locally, after cloning our repository you will want to set up a virtual environment. Inside that venv make sure to install the latest versions of keras and tensorflow along with the other dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

## Credits 

This project was inspired by my friends: Michael He (https://github.com/BATMOOSEMIKE), Kevin Fan and Wenfei. We worked on a similar project together called the Clothing Classifier in early March and I decided to recreate the machine learning model with a different dataset while using a similar front-end layout.
